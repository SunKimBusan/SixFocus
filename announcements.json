While SixFocus encourages focusing on **six key tasks per day**, domains help you structure your productivity without losing clarity. âœ¨\n\nAlthough you can create **unlimited domains**, we recommend keeping them to a **minimum** to maintain your focus. Too many domains may **dilute your attention** rather than enhance productivity. ðŸŽ¯\n\nYou can access domains through **Settings > Domains**, or by adding a **Domain icon** to the to-do list screen in **Settings > Appearance**. This feature will be available in **version 1.2.0**, which will be approved soon. ðŸš€ Stay tuned and enhance your workflow with SixFocus!",
