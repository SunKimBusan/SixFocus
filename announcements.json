When you enable this option, the task is marked as fully complete, won’t count toward your 6-task limit, and becomes unmodifiable. Rest assured, we’ve overhauled our data structure to preserve your local data, so there’s no need to worry about any data loss.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and trust in SixFocus. We hope this update brings enhanced efficiency and peace of mind to your daily workflow. May your tasks be ever manageable and your days filled with success and joy!\n\nBest regards,\nThe SixFocus Team",

        "content": "Why Six Tasks? The Idea Behind SixFocus🚀\n\nThe concept of the 'six-task rule' is most famously known as the **Ivy Lee Method**. In 1918, productivity consultant **Ivy Lee** introduced this method to steel magnate **Charles M. Schwab**. It’s a simple yet effective system: **write down the six most important tasks for the day and complete them in order of priority**. ✅\n\nI’ve been using this method for quite a long time. While it hasn’t led to some grand success, it has given me something even more valuable—**momentum**. No matter how difficult things get, this system helps me keep going, one step at a time. 🔄\n\nBefore anything else, I believe that **everyone should develop their own system for recording, organizing, and structuring their projects**. No tool or method will magically fix everything unless you first have a way to manage your own work effectively. 🛠️ In my case, I refine and document six essential tasks each day as part of my project management system. 📋\n\nWhy six? Honestly, it could be five or seven—I don’t have a perfect answer. But maybe, just like how honeycombs naturally form hexagons, six is simply the most **balanced and stable number**. 🐝\n\nThat’s why I created **SixFocus**—to help structure tasks in a way that promotes **consistency and focus**. I hope this system helps you stay on track and build the momentum you need. 🚀\n\nLet’s keep making progress, one step at a time! 💪",

While SixFocus encourages focusing on **six key tasks per day**, domains help you structure your productivity without losing clarity. ✨\n\nAlthough you can create **unlimited domains**, we recommend keeping them to a **minimum** to maintain your focus. Too many domains may **dilute your attention** rather than enhance productivity. 🎯\n\nYou can access domains through **Settings > Domains**, or by adding a **Domain icon** to the to-do list screen in **Settings > Appearance**. This feature will be available in **version 1.2.0**, which will be approved soon. 🚀 Stay tuned and enhance your workflow with SixFocus!",
